    I wanted to put a note in my page about the photos and text content I used on my page. I decided to use nike products because as I was building my page
  I realized having photos that had different sizes and background colors would make the pages look very chaotic, not to mention getting the photos to line
  up correctly and having all the same photos use the same dimensions would be very dificult. I figured if I was actually running my own store or had my own
  company I would have my own actual product photos and I could control what the photos looked like, their size, etc which would solve my problem but since I'm not, I would have to use somebody who has already done that work. So I just wanted to put a disclaimer and say that all the photos are from the nike website, and all the product descriptions/colors/prices are from nike themselves as well. Nothing else on my page is from them though. I created everything else myself.
